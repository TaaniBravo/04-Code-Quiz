// DECLARE our variables

// WHEN the page opens up the site starts with a title and a start button.

// WHEN the user clicks the START BUTTON we want the timer in the top-left corner to start counting down from 60.

// THEN the user is presented with a question.

// IF the user answers a question correctly then they are presented with another question and the user is rewarded a point.

// IF NOT then we don't want the page to change the question, but notify them in a textbox below that they are wrong and 5 seconds are removed off of the timer.

// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over. 

// WHEN the game is over then the user can save their name and score and it updates to the leaderboard.
