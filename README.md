# Legend of Zelda Quiz!
This is the homework assignment for week 4 of UW Coding Bootcamp. The assignment is to create a interactive quiz using JavaScript events and callback functions. For this assignment we are not given any start code. Our goal is to make the website have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

NOTE: While the user story and criteria call for a code quiz we were given permission to make the topic of the quiz on anything we wanted.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

## My Journey
```
This homework assignment was a doozy. While the HTML and CSS were quite easy for a simple interface, the JS was very heavy for a beginner. It felt like every implementation caused for a new error. While these errors were quite annoying and time consuming I am very glad I went through the pain of figuring them out. Whether I need the things to be explained to me or I found the solution on my own coming out of this assignment my understanding of JS has grown exponentially.

I found that the implementations of the buttons and then getting them to work properly with the functions of showing correct or incorrect (in this case minusing 5 second of the timer) to be the hardest because it seemed like whatever I did the function wanted to loop over and over giving me exaggerated results of what I wanted. This ultimately took the longest time to understand, but now I know how arrow functions, event delegation, and for each loops work on top of the other topics we need to make this assignment work.

## Resources
```
Ania Kubow (YouTube):  helped me with the understanding of a simple timer. I then add the things that I need for it to do.

Web Dev Simplified (YouTube): WDS helped me in many ways. He gave me some good pointers to think about when starting this project. Ultimately I used his sort method to make the quiz random as other methods I found were really long and complex compared to his one line solution.

Brian Design (YouTube): Brian was very essential in me learning how to apply dynamically the questions and answers for my quiz. His quiz was much more simple so I took what I learned early in his video and applied the same logic/theory for my own use. 

dcode (YouTube): dcode really helped me with my understanding of localstorage and how to store an object.

Sam Pai (Tutor): When I felt really stuck and not know what the next steps were Sam helped guide me while letting me lead so that I could understand why I needed functions where.

Anthony Brown (Instructor): Anthony was a great resource for me when I didn't understand foundational JavaScript. He pointed out why things did what and where they need to be.
