This is the homework assignment for week 4 of UW Coding Bootcamp. The assignment is to create a interactive quiz using JavaScript events and callback functions. 


## Resources
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSV_Ml2_A88 - Ania Kubow helped me with the understanding of a simple timer. I then add the things that I need for it to do.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&t=892s - Web Dev Simplified help me in many ways. He gave me some good pointers to think about when starting this project. Ultimately I used his sort method to make the quiz random as other methods I found were really long and complex compared to his solution.
